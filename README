Building
============================================================
To build with the model and view, run:
./configure 
make


FIXME: disable-view not working
To build without the view and just the model, run:
./configure --disable-view

To clear the files made using configure, for example when switching between
building with and without a view run 
make distclean

If you need to add more sources files, add them to Makefile.am, then run
autoreconf 
before running ./configure again

If ./configure has problems finding a C compiler, add you mpi C and C++
compilers to the lines in configure.ac
AC_PROG_CC([mpicc])
AC_PROG_CXX([mpic++ mpicxx])
And run autoreconf


Running
============================================================
The binary parallel2DLJMD will be in bin. If built with the view, by default
task 0 will run the view and rest will run with the model. If built with the
view disabled, all mpi tasks will run the model

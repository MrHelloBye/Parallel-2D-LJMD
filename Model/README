This is a parallelized version of the 2D MD code using OpenMPI (Message Passing Interface).
The parallelization is done via domain decomposition. Each processor has a subsystem for which it
performs all calculations. When atoms move between domains, information is exchanged using Isend and Irecieve MPI calls.
Mirror boundary conditions are applied for exterior system boundaries. A cutoff radius where force calculations byond the radius are ignored, is used to significantly speed up calculations.

To run from terminal on Linux (must have OpenMPI installed)

1. make
2. mpirun -np [number of processors] MPI-md 

Note: For stability, each processor's domain must be approximately square.
